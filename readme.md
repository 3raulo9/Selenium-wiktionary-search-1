# Selenium Web Scraping Script with Undetected ChromeDriver

This Python script uses `undetected_chromedriver` along with `selenium` to perform web scraping tasks. Specifically, it navigates to [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org/), searches for a term in Russian, and extracts the pronunciation section if available.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version (can be downloaded from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/))

## Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium
